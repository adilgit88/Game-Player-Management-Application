# Game Player Management Application ‚Äì CS 230 Module Four

> A RESTful API demo secured with Basic Authentication using Dropwizard, developed for **The Gaming Room** as part of Creative Technology Solutions (CTS) consulting.

## üìú Overview

This Java-based REST application demonstrates how to:
- Create and secure REST endpoints
- Authenticate and authorize users using **Basic Authentication**
- Manage access to endpoints using **role-based annotations**
- Simulate a login experience for different user types (ADMIN, USER, PLAYER, GUEST)

## üß∞ Tech Stack

- **Java 17**
- **Dropwizard Framework** (`io.dropwizard`)
- **Maven Project**
- **HTTP/REST + Jersey**
